# NerdSoloMiner

**The NerdSoloMiner v2**

This is a **free and open source project** that let you try to reach a bitcoin block with a small piece of hardware.

The main aim of this project is to let you **learn more about minery** and to have a beautiful piece of hardware in your desktop.

## Requirements

- TTGO T-Display S3 or any supported boards (check Build tutorial 👇)
- 3D BOX [here](3d_files/)

### Project description

**ESP32 implementing Stratum protocol** to mine on solo pool. Pool can be changed but originally works with [public-pool.io](https://web.public-pool.io) (where Nerdminers are supported).

This project was initialy developed using ESP32-S3, but currently support other boards. It uses WifiManager to modify miner settings and save them to SPIFF.
The microMiner comes with several screens to monitor it's working procedure and also to show you network mining stats.
Currently includes:

- NerdMiner Screen > Mining data of Nerdminer
- ClockMiner Screen > Fashion style clock miner
- GlobalStats Screen > Global minery stats and relevant data

This miner is multicore and multithreads, both cores are used to mine and several threads are used to implementing stratum work and wifi stuff.
Every time an stratum job notification is received miner update its current work to not create stale shares.

**IMPORTANT** Miner is not seen by all standard pools due to its low share difficulty. You can check miner work remotely using specific pools specified down or seeing logs via UART.

**_Current project is still in developement and more features will be added_**

#### Current Supported Boards with stand alone displays
- ESP32 devkitC V4 - SSD1306 (I²C controller) ([Pinout & example photo](images/ESP32_SSD1306/README.md) / [Board Info](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/hw-reference/esp32/get-started-devkitc.html))

### Flash firmware

#### microMiners Flashtool [Recommended]

Easyiest way to flash firmware. Build your own miner using the folowing firwmare flash tool:

1. Get a TTGO T-display S3 or any other supported board
1. Go to NM2 flasher online: https://flasher.bitronics.store/ (recommend via Google Chrome incognito mode)

#### Standard tool

Create your own miner using the online firwmare flash tool **ESPtool** and one of the **binary files** that you will find in the `bin` folder.
If you want you can compile the entire project using Arduino, PlatformIO or Expressif IDF.

1. Get a TTGO T-display S3 or any supported board
1. Download this repository
1. Go to ESPtool online: https://espressif.github.io/esptool-js/
1. Load the firmware with the binary from one of the sub-folders of `bin` corresponding to your board.
1. Plug your board and select each file from the sub-folder (`.bin` files).

### Update firmware

Update NerdMiner firmware following same flashing steps but only using the file 0x10000_firmware.bin.

#### Build troubleshooting

1. Online [ESP Tool](https://espressif.github.io/esptool-js/) works with chrome, chromium, brave
1. ESPtool recommendations: use 115200bps
1. Build errors > If during firmware download upload stops, it's recommended to enter the board in boot mode. Unplug cable, hold right bottom button and then plug cable. Try programming
1. In extreme case you can "Erase all flash" on ESPtool to clean all current configuration before uploading firmware. There has been cases that experimented Wifi failures until this was made.
1. In case of ESP32-WROOM Boards, could be necessary to put your board on boot mode. Hold boot button, press reset button and then program.

## NerdMiner configuration

After programming, you will only need to setup your Wifi and BTC address.

Note: when BTC address of your selected wallet is not provided, mining will not be started.

#### Wifi Accesspoint


1. Connect to NerdMinerAP
   - AP: NerdMinerAP
   - PASS: MineYourCoins
1. Set up your Wifi Network
1. Add your BTC address
1. Change the password if needed

   - If you are using public-pool.io and you want to set a custom name to your worker you can append a string with format _.yourworkername_ to the address


#### SD card (if available)

1. Format a SD card using Fat32.
1. Create a file named "config.json" in your card's root, containing the the following structure. Adjust the settings to your needs:  
```
{  
  "SSID": "myWifiSSID",  
  "WifiPW": "myWifiPassword",  
  "PoolUrl": "public-pool.io",  
  "PoolPort": 21496,
  "PoolPassword": "x",
  "BtcWallet": "walletID",  
  "Timezone": 2,  
  "SaveStats": false  
}
```

1. Insert the SD card.
1. Hold down the "reset configurations" button as described below to reset the configurations and/or boot without settings in your nvmemory.
1. Power down to remove the SD card. It is not needed for mining.
