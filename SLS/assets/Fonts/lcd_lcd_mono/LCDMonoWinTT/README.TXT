LCDMono is a monospaced variant of the LCD font family.
The lower-case and upper-case characters are identical.

The LCDMono font family contains the following fonts:

   o  LCDMono-Normal  -- a liquid-crystal-display-style font with
                         an 8-degree slant.
   o  LCDMono-Bold    -- the bold version of LCDMono.
   o  LCDMono-Light   -- a lighter-weight version of LCDMono.
   o  LCDMono-Ultra   -- the ultra-bold version of LCDMono.
   
   o  LCDMono2-Normal -- Same as LCD-Normal, but with wider gaps between
                         character elements (twice as wide, in fact).
   o  LCDMono2-Bold   -- the bold version of LCDMono2.
   o  LCDMono2-Light  -- a lighter-weight version of LCDMono2.
   o  LCDMono2-Ultra  -- the ultra-bold version of LCDMono2.

If you use both large and small type in the same layout or graphic, you may 
want to use LCDMono for the large type and LCDMono2 for the small type.
