LCD (and its variants) is an upper-case-only typeface.  The lower-case 
characters are identical to the upper-case characters, with the exception 
of the letters "J", "M", "W", and "Y".  To see the difference between the 
upper- and lower-case symbols, enter the alphabet in both upper- and 
lower-case in your word processor, and set the font to LCD. I recommend 
that you use either all upper-case or all lower-case characters with this 
font.

Note: The original version of LCD2 had proportionally-spaced numerals.
This was incorrect. The current version has monospaced numerals, to
match LCD.

The LCD font family contains the following fonts:

   o  LCD-Normal  -- a liquid-crystal-display-style font with
                     an 8-degree slant. Numerals are monospaced
					 to make columns line up.
   o  LCD-Bold    -- the bold version of LCD.
   o  LCD-Light   -- a lighter-weight version of LCD.
   o  LCD-Ultra   -- the ultra-bold version of LCD.
   
   o  LCD2-Normal -- same as LCD-Normal, but gaps between character
                     elements are twice as wide, for better definition
					 at low resolution or small point sizes.
   o  LCD2-Bold   -- the bold version of LCD2.
   o  LCD2-Light  -- a lighter-weight version of LCD2.
   o  LCD2-Ultra  -- the ultra-bold version of LCD2.

LCD-Bold (uppercase) is a good match for the typeface used on the covers of 
Ground Zero Games' "Full Thrust" and "More Thrust" rulebooks. For smaller
type sizes at lower resolutions (such as 72dpi screens), I recommend that
you use LCD2.

If you use both large and small type in the same layout or graphic, you may 
want to use LCDMono for the large type and LCDMono2 for the small type.  
For example, for the Full Thrust banner graphic, you may want to use 
LCD-Bold/72 pt for "Full Thrust" and LCD2-Bold/30 pt for "Fleet Actions in 
Deep Space".

These fonts are available in TrueType format for Windows and Macintosh.  If 
you need a Postscript version of these fonts, please contact the author at

Updated version of these fonts, as well as other fonts, may become 
available from time to time on the author's font website, at

Enjoy!
